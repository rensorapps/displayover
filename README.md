Initially bsed on https://benoitpasquier.com/webcam-utility-app-macos-swiftui/

Works well in conjunction with QuickTime for screen recording.

## Usage

See the application menus (with shortcuts listed) for functions such as:

* Changing camera
* Changing overlay shape
* Changing mirroring

When focused, the title bar is present with action buttons and can be used for easily finding the corner for resizing the overlay.

Pressing the "?" button when hovering will take you to this page. Hi!

distribution portability, but if you want to build and run it yourself rather
than getting it off the Apple App Store, then be our guest!
